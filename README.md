# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

It is important to keep up with the specified time of delivery because this would give you a chance to work on any emerging errors. It is also very important since it will keep all the stakeholders satisfied and it will also attract investors.

To make sure projects are done on time:
  - Ensure you choose the right development methodology for your project.
  - Ensure the developers clearly understand the problem that is being solved.
  - Do a proper analysis during the analysis stage of development.
  - Come up with teams to handle differnt modules of the project.
  - Ensure there is an easy way for teams to collaborate on the project.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Cost control would enable you to have enough money for every part of the project. If cost is managed properly,  you will be able to cater for the project properly and you can also have enough money to handle any extra costs that come up as the development process continues.

To have proper cost managment:
  - Do comprehensive feasibility study.
  - Do a proper anaylsis of requirements and the projects specification.
  - Have a proper understanding of the purpose of the project before development begins.
  - Choose the right development methodology for your budget and project type.
  - Avoid unnecessary additions to the project. Stick to the core purpose and features that are within the budget.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

When you clearly define the problem, you will understand exactly what the software will have to look like. This will help you come up with the perfect design for the software which will help developers have an easy time coding the project.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
